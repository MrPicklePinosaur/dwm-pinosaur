### Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
- libx11-dev
- libxft-dev
- libxinerama-dev
- libxcv-dev
- libx11-xcb-dev
- libxcb-res0-dev

### Installation (make)
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Then run

An ebuild will be available on my website for Gentoo users sometime.
The `savedconfig` and `xinerama` use flags will be available.
